  # Library
  library(tidyverse)
  library(gagglr)
  
  # Load data
  df_msd <- return_latest("Data", "PSNU_IM") %>%
    read_psd()
  
  # Filter dataset to just HTS Index data
  df_index <- df_msd %>% 
    filter(indicator == "HTS_TST",

# EXERCISE ----------------------------------------------------------------

  # What do each quartersâ€™ index testing results look like in Alfred Nzo in FY23?
  # what about cumulative?
  # Use filter() and summarize() with across()
  
  df_index %>% 
    filter("...") %>% #what PSNU to filter to? what else?
    group_by("...") %>% #what vars to group by
    summarize(across(c("..."), # what variable to sum on if we are looking at results? 
                     \(x) sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)),
              .groups = "drop")
  
  df_index %>% 
    filter(psnu == "ec Alfred Nzo District Municipality") %>% #what PSNU to filter to? what else?
    group_by(psnu, indicator, fiscal_year) %>% #what vars to group by
    summarize(across(starts_with("qtr"), # what variable to sum on if we are looking at results? 
                     \(x) sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)),
